#April, 2019: Dr. Mihaela Iordanova

Dr. Mihaela Iordanova is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Concordia University. Dr. Iordanova earned her doctorate in the laboratory of Dr. Fred Westbrook at the University of New South Wales, and conducted her postdoctoral training at both Cardiff University and the National Institute of Drug Abuse. Currently, the Iordanova Lab employs cutting-edge techniques with meticulously-designed, theoretically-based behavior to study how the brain changes in response to prediction error and fine tune our understanding of this type of learning.

###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__

We are currently looking at how fear memories are inferred across time. Whether rats do this retrospectively or prospectively makes such memories differentially dependent on the original emotional event and are thus underscored by different associative architecture. We are using the Fos-lacZ transgenic rat to determine whether deletion of neuronal ensembles activated by the original emotional memory affects the integrity of inferred memories. This allows us to look at the interdependence of memories and explore how different brain areas and circuits support this learning. I am very excited about this, because it exemplifies the complexity of normal memory but also bears relevance to the difficulty of treating trauma-based psychopathologies in humans. 
 
###__Are there any benefits to being a woman in learning?__

It is a great time to be a woman in the field of learning and neuroscience. Awareness of the hardship faced by women is growing fast and I feel lucky that this is happening in my lifetime. It also gives us an opportunity to make a difference that will benefit the next generation of female researchers. I also feel really blessed to be part of a network comprised of strong like-minded established and junior female scientists. 

###__What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?__

Travel more. You don’t have to spend every weekend in the lab to be productive. 

###__What is a fun fact about you that people might be surprised to know?__

I love jumping, so I recently bought a fitness trampoline. Now, I mostly spend my time negotiating with my kids when my turn to jump is. 

###__What has been your favorite place you’ve traveled to so far?__

A little village by the seaside in Northern Bulgaria by the Romanian border. I went there with a close friend many years ago and we spent the time philosophizing about life, while listening to music, smoking cigarettes, and drinking wine by the Black sea. 

###__Who is your favorite band or artist?__

This changes all the time for me. Right now, it’s Parov Stelar. He combines some of my favourite music genres – jazz, house, electro.  

###__Finally, what do you love about the Pavlovian Society?__

The great thing about the Pavlovian Society is that it has really deep behavioral roots, yet this does not come at the expense of cutting-edge neuroscience. Without understanding behavior, there is no hope of understanding brain function. The Pavlovian Society does not compromise and really has this right. I am really proud to be a part of it.

#March, 2019: Dr. Susan Sangha


![Dr. Sangha in her lab at Purdue University.](./photos/Sangha_lab.jpg)

Dr. Susan Sangha is an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience in the Department of Psychological Sciences at Purdue University and the Purdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience. Before starting her own lab in Purdue, Dr. Sangha received her PhD from the University of Calgary in the lab of Dr. Ken Lukowiak and completed separate postdoctoral fellowships under Dr. Hans-Christian Pape and Dr. Patricia Janak. Dr. Sangha and her students combine elegant behavior with in vivo single-unit electrophysiology and pharmacogenetics to understand how the brain changes during fear, safety, and reward cue learning.

###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__

Right now, we have some exciting neural data from the PFC collected in freely behaving rats during our safety learning task. At the single neuron level, we are seeing many neurons in the infralimbic cortex responding to a learned safety cue while fear behavior is being suppressed.

###__What challenges, if any, have you experienced as a woman in learning?__

I feel like I have been overall quite lucky to have had really supportive mentors, both male and female, throughout my career. However, when I got my faculty position and was the 'boss' of the lab and classroom, it appeared to me I was not getting the same level of respect from students, in the classroom and in the lab, as a new male PI would. 

###__What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?__

That would be 2009, when I finished my first postdoc and was starting my second postdoc. The thing I did right was take a chance and start my line of research on safety learning. The advice I would give myself would probably be “ok, breathe, relax, it’ll all be fine”. I was too stressed about getting the faculty position. I obviously succeeded in getting one, but life would have been fine if I didn’t.
 
###__What’s your favorite pie?__

I don’t like pie. I do like chocolate cake though.
 
###__What’s your favorite season?__

Fall, I go gaga over colorful fall foliage.
 
###__What’s your ideal Saturday out of the office?__

Being outside, taking photos and playing with my dog. I don’t live near mountains anymore but a hike in the mountains would be a perfect Saturday. 

###__What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?__

Over the years, it has become to me an interactive and supportive community filled with other learning nerds.
