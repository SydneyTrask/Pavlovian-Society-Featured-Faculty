###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__

The big and somewhat grand problem we (and many other labs) are working on is trying to understand how the brain encodes, stores and uses information. We believe that this is a fundamental property of brain function. One could imagine that dysfunction of information processing could lie at the heart of a number of human disorders (from autism spectrum disorder to Alzheimer’s disease). Our memories make us who we are, and understanding how memories are formed and used, I believe is a hugely fascinating question. 

###__If you could research something completely unrelated to your lab’s focus, what would it be?__ 

I would like to do some pure modeling studies. All in silico.

###__What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your career?__

I found getting a faculty position quite challenging. Other than that, I find every day being a scientist a little challenging, but in a good way. 

###__What advice would you give your graduate student self?__ 

To enjoy the ride. That if you focus on the work, then things will eventually work out. My mother always told me (and I would tell my younger self) that things work out in the end. If things are not working out, then it means it is not yet the end.

###__If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?__

Writer. I love to write. Or more accurately, I love to have written!

###__What is/are your favorite non-science related activity?__

I like to spend time with my family, hike and watch basketball. I also really enjoy baking. It’s like working at the bench and (most of the time) following a recipe, seeing how it turns out and then altering it!

###__What is your favorite time of the year?__ 

Summer - love the hot weather. I also like fall because it always feels like a fresh start.

###__What is your favorite thing about Women in learning?__

Hanging out with smart and funny women.

###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__

Right now I’m most excited about our project with the most unknowns. It’s a collaboration with Bob Datta at Harvard Med School, who’s developed a super-sophisticated behavioral analysis tool using a 3D depth camera that you’d find in an X-box. We’re working with them to evaluate complex conditioned fear behaviors, which could help us develop predictive profiles of resilient vs. susceptible phenotypes in males and females. What I especially love about this project is that it’s completely an undergraduate endeavor – my student Sierra came to work with us having zero lab experience, and I basically said, “See if you can figure out how to do this” and she just did it! I’m constantly amazed at the creativity and resourcefulness my students have.

###__Looking back at your career so far, what are you most proud of?__

Our lab motto is “No shrugging” – meaning, if something seems wrong, don’t live with it; fix it. So it might sound hokey, but I’m most proud of the times that I refused to shrug. This includes successfully fighting a negative tenure decision—one of the most mentally and emotionally challenging 6 months of my life—and being a long-time vocal advocate for studying both sexes in neuroscience research. In both cases, I feel like I have genuinely helped move the needle on the way people think about the culture of academic science, both in and outside of the laboratory, and that’s pretty satisfying. 

###__If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?__

I wouldn’t have known how to answer this question five years ago, but in 2015 my husband and I bought a dilapidated little house in East Boston and did a full gut renovation, just like on HGTV! We didn’t do the construction work ourselves, but I designed the whole house, and although there was a lot about the process that was super stressful, I really loved the creative aspect.  Picking out backsplash tile, wallpaper, floor stain, and seeing all those little decisions come together into beautiful spaces (that I now get to live in!) was just awesome.  I learned a ton and found that I may have a bit of an eye for this stuff. So if I had to start over and couldn’t choose science as a career, I would probably go to design school and help people make their homes pretty.  

###__What is/are your favorite non-science related activity?__

It’s summer, and so I am VERY into my vegetable garden. We’re super lucky to have a backyard right in the middle of the city, and we have raised beds with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, string beans, and herbs. Every morning before I leave for lab I pour myself a little iced coffee and go out and just look at all my plants in total awe that they were these tiny little things not even 2 months ago and now they’re gigantic and producing all this amazing fruit. On the weekends I work to keep the tomatoes suckers pinched and the cucumber vines going up—it’s a fun thing to focus on that not only keeps me from thinking about work all the time, but is also incredibly rewarding and delicious!

###__What is your dream vacation?__

Without question, I want to go to Japan for like a month and just eat. Traveling and eating are two of my favorite activities, so if my plan to be an interior decorator doesn’t work out, I suppose I could fall back on hosting a show where I just travel to amazing places and eat.  

###__What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?__
 
I’ve only been involved in Pavlovian Society for a couple of years so I admit that in a sense I feel like a bit of an impostor. The science is amazing, obviously. But what Pavlovian really gets right—and what is immediately clear to a newcomer—is its inclusivity. Even though there are some true legends involved, it doesn’t feel like one of those scientific societies that’s run by the “old guard.” There are visible leadership roles for trainees, and I think that’s a really fantastic model that other societies should emulate.  I also love the Women’s luncheon. It is so, so important to highlight the amazing accomplishments of women in our field, while also speaking plainly and openly about the challenges women in STEM continue to face.

###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__
All the projects! My biggest issue is wanting to do all the things, all the time. But, probably the neuroimmune modulation of memory project. This project has everything: Sex differences, long-lasting impact on memory, relationships with Alzheimer’s disease, multiple levels of analysis, and astrocytes!

###__What advice would you give yourself as a graduate student?__ 
Don’t feel the need to follow “the rules” of how an academic career is supposed to work. Do it your own way. It will either work out or it won’t, but you’ll be happier for following your own path along the way.

###__If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?__

This is an existential question for me! I’ll always be a scientist, even if I don’t always work in academia or science. But outside of academia? I have no idea. I’ve never had a Plan B. I’ve never really had a Master Plan either - I’ve just followed what I loved and sought out opportunities as I’ve gone along.
But in an alternate timeline where I did not study science at university, I would probably have continued to study music – composition more than performance. 
  
###__If you could go anywhere in the world and do anything for one day, where would you go and what would you do?__

Just one day? Just one thing? Something involving spectacular nature views, water to swim/play in, warm weather, and my family. Alternatively: a day in Antarctica.

###__What is one of your favorite memories as a child?__

A bus trip with my family through the center of Australia to Uluru (Ayers Rock) when I was 10. You wouldn’t think that days and days and days on a bus through the desert where the only other kids were your own siblings would be so fun, but it was a great trip. 

###__What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?__

I love that it has a great cross-section of people that study memory across all levels of analysis, starting with theory and behavior, to circuits and systems, and molecular mechanisms. And all of whom come back to the importance of understanding behavior as a central tenet to how to study learning and memory.

###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__
The people in my lab have been working on some awesome projects! My graduate student Gerardo Rojas is beginning some experiments we've wanted to pursue for a few years now, related to how dopamine function might be different in mouse models of autism, and how this might relate to their different approaches to motivated behavior and executive function. He's already finding things I wouldn't have expected. It's thrilling to see something exist just because we had an idea. But equally exciting is the work my graduate student Cathy Chen is doing to understand how strategies in decision making in a reinforcement learning task differs in male and female animals, which is pulling us into research directions I didn't know existed a a few years ago. I admit that as thrilling as getting to find out answers to our burning questions can be, its even more satisfying to have people in the lab develop independence to come up with better questions than I ever would, and answer them. So I would say I'm most excited for the things I don't know yet!

###__Looking back at your career so far, what are you most proud of?__
Surviving! Surviving despite the fact that the vast majority of the time, I am basically winging it. But so is everybody else, for the most part.

###__Is there any advice you want to give to trainees in the learning field?__
There are lots of people employing learning techniques to prove a point about neuroscience that is fundamentally biological, and they aren't always doing a very careful job defining what they mean by psychological terms like learning. You have an opportunity as skilled observers of behavior to do science that addresses this problem, but to do so means figuring out which modern neuroscience techniques you want to incorporate into your training. Bridging this gap is incredibly exciting to me. We will never figure out how learning works by being precise in one domain and vague in another. 

###__If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?__
Noted, independently wealthy bon vivant and wit. Or, failing this, I might work with animal behavior in some non-scientific way, like training animals for film productions. I really enjoy training both my own pets and other people's. In both of these career paths, there's a lot of figuring out how to connect with the individual in front of you, whether you are trying to make them laugh (humans), trying to make them sit (animals), or trying to make them shake hands (both).

###__What’s your favorite pie?__
Strawberry Rhubarb. Rhubarb looks like poisonous celery and somehow we are using it in pie? And it's delicious? Who is responsible for this.

###__If you could go anywhere in the world and do anything for one day, where would you go and what would you do?__
I once got to go to Lake Como, north of Milan, and ride the ferry between little towns on the lake. I would go back there and I would spend the day figuring out how to stay there longer than one day. 

###__What is/are your favorite non-science related activity/activities?__
I love shopping for necklaces. Shopping is not the most wholesome activity. Let me try again. I like to drink beverages, both nonalcoholic and boozy, in beautiful environments and listen to my friends. I also like to paint small paintings, usually about 2 or 3 inches in size. I love logic puzzles and party games. The critical thing about all my favorite activities is they always involve access to indoor plumbing and climate control, and usually comfortable chairs.

###__What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?__
I love that there is a dedicated meeting for learned behavior. I appreciate that the motivation for the science is to understand the behavior and learning processes that drive it, not to understand a molecule or a specific circuit. Those are important too, but sometimes you need the expertise of a bunch of behavioral scientists.

![_Dr. Grissom (L) with her PhD advisor, Dr. Seema Bhatnagar (R). On being a woman in science, Dr. Grissom said, "There’s a benefit of the doubt that people in the majority get, that doesn’t get extended as easily to women, or to people of color, or intersections thereof. So a grant proposal, or a finding, gets just a little bit more pushback from a reviewer - not just the approach, but sometimes even the premise that a particular question is worth studying. That hurts success directly, chips away at grant scores and paper reviews. Not only that, but resisting that pushback, that doubt, from every person it radiates from even a little, over each project it happened on - that takes energy away that could ideally go to your next big idea, the next paper, the next great opportunity. The best thing you can do is not internalize the doubt. Know your worth." _](./photos/Grissom2.jpg)

###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__

I pretty excited about all the work going on in our lab. But at the top of my mind right now is a project we’ve been working on basically since I started the lab. We are picking apart the reciprocal cortical-amygdala circuit that helps you learn about rewarding events and then retrieve those memories in the future to make good reward pursuit decisions.

###__Why is your research important to the general public?__

What we’re trying to do is to figure out how your brain learns about rewarding events and how it uses that information to direct your actions, motivations, and decisions. This allows us to expose vulnerabilities in the brain that can lead to maladaptive behavior and mental illness. From there we work to figure out how to restore adaptive function, thus revealing new treatment strategies for mental illness and neurodegenerative diseases. In our lab, we focus on addiction and depression, though our goal is to make our basic science work relevant to a broad array of psychiatric conditions.

###__What’s one skill or hobby you want to learn outside of science?__

Photography. I love taking pictures, especially portraits. But lately my toddler won’t sit still for mommy’s photoshoots, so I’ve gotten more into travel/adventure photography. I’m learning, slowly but surely.

###__What was the first research question you remember being excited about? Is it totally different from what you do now?__

How do different addictive drugs differentially affect dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens? At the time, FSCV was all the rage and I found it incredibly exciting to give a subject a drug and immediately see how it’s dopamine release changed. It was incredibly reinforcing and the dopamine those data elicited in my nucleus accumbens is probably why I’m a scientist. I still study dopamine.

###__Can you describe a turning point that was important to your career?__

When I was a postdoc, David Jentsch invited me to lunch. I had no clue what he wanted to talk about. At that lunch he suggested I apply for the open faculty position in his department, UCLA Psychology. I was shocked, I didn’t think I was yet qualified to go on the job market. His confidence in me gave me confidence in myself. This is my current job and I absolutely love it. I’m incredibly grateful for this career-changing encouragement. I think sometimes as women we don’t put ourselves up for things (grants, jobs, promotions, awards, etc.) for fear we’re not going to be competitive, we’re not ready, we’re not qualified, whatever. In addition to leading to my current job, this experience taught me to just go for the things I want. I hope I’m effective in spreading this advice and encouragement to others.

###__What’s your ideal Sunday out of the office?__

Get up early and head to the Sunday Hollywood farmer’s market with my family. Have a huge breakfast from one of the vendors (usually a crepe or breakfast burrito), and get some delicious fresh local produce. My daughter stuffs herself on free samples. Afterwards we go for a hike in Runyon Canyon or maybe Griffith park if we’re feeling adventurous. Come home for a nap (you said ideal, right? In my ideal world parent naps are a thing). Then head to the park to play with my daughter, followed by happy hour with my family and friends.

###__Finally, what do you love about the Pavlovian Society?__

The behavior. I love that at this meeting the sophistication in neural analysis and behavioral analysis are both incredibly high. I think this leads to interesting and important advances in understanding associative learning and all the many processes it influences (motivation, emotion, decision making, etc.). I also love how I leave the meeting with lots of great ideas for future experiments and collaborations.

###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__

We are currently looking at how fear memories are inferred across time. Whether rats do this retrospectively or prospectively makes such memories differentially dependent on the original emotional event and are thus underscored by different associative architecture. We are using the Fos-lacZ transgenic rat to determine whether deletion of neuronal ensembles activated by the original emotional memory affects the integrity of inferred memories. This allows us to look at the interdependence of memories and explore how different brain areas and circuits support this learning. I am very excited about this, because it exemplifies the complexity of normal memory but also bears relevance to the difficulty of treating trauma-based psychopathologies in humans. 
 
###__Are there any benefits to being a woman in learning?__

It is a great time to be a woman in the field of learning and neuroscience. Awareness of the hardship faced by women is growing fast and I feel lucky that this is happening in my lifetime. It also gives us an opportunity to make a difference that will benefit the next generation of female researchers. I also feel really blessed to be part of a network comprised of strong like-minded junior and established female scientists. 

###__What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?__

Travel more. You don’t have to spend every weekend in the lab to be productive. 

###__What is a fun fact about you that people might be surprised to know?__

I love jumping, so I recently bought a fitness trampoline. Now, I mostly spend my time negotiating with my kids when my turn to jump is. 

###__What has been your favorite place you’ve traveled to so far?__

A little village in the northeastern part of Bulgaria right by the Romanian border on the Black Sea. I went there with a close friend many years ago and we spent the time philosophizing about life, while listening to music, smoking cigarettes, and drinking wine.

###__Who is your favorite band or artist?__

This changes all the time for me. Right now, it’s Parov Stelar. He combines some of my favourite music genres – jazz, house, electro.  

###__Finally, what do you love about the Pavlovian Society?__

The great thing about the Pavlovian Society is that it has really deep behavioral roots, yet this does not come at the expense of cutting-edge neuroscience. Without understanding behavior, there is no hope of understanding brain function. The Pavlovian Society does not compromise and really has this right. I am really proud to be a part of it.

###__What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?__

Right now, we have some exciting neural data from the PFC collected in freely behaving rats during our safety learning task. At the single neuron level, we are seeing many neurons in the infralimbic cortex responding to a learned safety cue while fear behavior is being suppressed.

###__What challenges, if any, have you experienced as a woman in learning?__

I feel like I have been overall quite lucky to have had really supportive mentors, both male and female, throughout my career. However, when I got my faculty position and was the 'boss' of the lab and classroom, it appeared to me I was not getting the same level of respect from students, in the classroom and in the lab, as a new male PI would. 

###__What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?__

That would be 2009, when I finished my first postdoc and was starting my second postdoc. The thing I did right was take a chance and start my line of research on safety learning. The advice I would give myself would probably be “ok, breathe, relax, it’ll all be fine”. I was too stressed about getting the faculty position. I obviously succeeded in getting one, but life would have been fine if I didn’t.
 
###__What’s your favorite pie?__

I don’t like pie. I do like chocolate cake though.
 
###__What’s your favorite season?__

Fall, I go gaga over colorful fall foliage.
 
###__What’s your ideal Saturday out of the office?__

Being outside, taking photos and playing with my dog. I don’t live near mountains anymore but a hike in the mountains would be a perfect Saturday. 

###__What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?__

Over the years, it has become to me an interactive and supportive community filled with other learning nerds.
