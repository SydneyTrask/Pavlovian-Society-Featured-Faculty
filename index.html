<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>There are two projects that I’m super excited about right now. First, we are trying to understand the functional role of circadian genes in modulating memory formation across the day/night cycle. We have found that at least one circadian gene, Period1 (Per1) plays an important role in memory formation and our most recent data suggest that Per1 may function differently during the day versus at night, changing the likelihood of memory formation. We’re also investigating how memories are modified in response to new information. As a side project in my postdoc lab, I developed a task (called OUL – Objects in Updated Locations) that can assess both an original memory and updated information in a single test session. We’re using OUL now to figure out how memory updating is different from initial memory formation.</p>

<div id="if-you-could-give-one-piece-of-advice-to-yourself-as-a-trainee-what-would-it-be" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>If you could give one piece of advice to yourself as a trainee, what would it be?</strong></h3>
<p>Learn when to cut off a project or technique that’s not working and switch to something else. It took me a while to realize that an important part of science is learning when to cut your losses and instead try a different approach or ask a new question. It’s something you learn with time, but sometimes when things aren’t working, it makes you concentrate on what is working and that’s often where you find the interesting, unexpected discoveries!</p>
</div>
<div id="what-isare-your-favorite-non-science-related-activities" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is/are your favorite non-science related activities?</strong></h3>
<p>I love to read, play volleyball (even though it has been a while!), and spend time with my family.</p>

<div id="how-do-you-create-a-healthy-worklife-balance-for-yourself-and-your-lab-members" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>How do you create a healthy work/life balance for yourself and your lab members?</strong></h3>
<p>Building the right lab environment has been super important to me since we opened our doors in January. I was fortunate to start my lab with a really fantastic technician (Kasuni Bodinayake – keep an eye on her – she’s applying to PhD programs right now!) who has been instrumental in setting a positive tone for our new lab. Everyone in lab works really hard and I’m proud of the good, solid science we’re doing, but I’m also proud to see that everyone is thriving outside of lab, too.</p>

<h3><strong>What advice would you give to a graduate student in the field of learning and memory who is looking to become an independent investigator in the future?</strong></h3>
<p>Work on your communication skills, both speaking and writing. As an incoming graduate student I had no idea how much of this job involves writing and speaking. Being able to communicate your science is fundamental and can be the difference in whether you get a job offer or get a grant. These are things that you learn with time, so practice early and often.</p>

<h3><strong>What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>I love that everyone in the Pavlovian Society appreciates how important and nuanced behavior is. It’s also a really great group of people and I love getting to see some of my oldest friends at the yearly meeting. I’m also really proud of <a href="https://www.womeninlearning.com">Women in Learning (WIL)</a> and the work we’re doing.</p>

<p>Dr. Nadia Chaudhri is an Associate Professor of Psychology at Concordia University and Director of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology. She completed her PhD at the University of Pittsburgh and conducted her postdoctoral training at the University of California, San Francisco. In her lab, Dr. Chaudhri and her trainees study the neurobiological mechanisms of addictive behaviors using appetitive conditioning paradigms (both Pavlovian and instrumental) and neuroscientific techniques like neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology, and immunohistochemistry. They are especially interested in how cues become paired with reinforcing stimuli in a way that promotes relapse following extinction.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-1" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>It’s impossible to pick a favourite, so I’ll tell you about 2. My graduate students (Alexa Brown and Franz Villaruel) are studying brain regions involved in appetitive extinction. Experiments in this project that branched away from standard extinction paradigms have produced exciting results. Another graduate student (Mandy LeCocq) adapted the reinstatement paradigm for use with alcohol, and her project is generating heaps of interesting data.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-triggered-your-passion-for-studying-learning-and-memory" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What triggered your passion for studying learning and memory?</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve always loved biology, and have a clear memory from high school of the first time I saw cell division through a microscope. I wasn’t introduced to the brain or Psychology until college, and my fascination with biology transmuted into a desire to understand the neural basis of behaviour, particularly maladaptive behaviour like excessive drug use. I draw on the rigorous behavioural designs in learning and memory research to inform my work on extinction learning and substance use disorders.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-could-research-something-completely-different-what-would-it-be" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>If you could research something completely different, what would it be?</strong></h3>
<p>I’d study plant biology. I’m crazy about plants, fungi and growing my own food.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-you-most-excited-about-in-the-learning-and-memory-field" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What are you most excited about in the learning and memory field?</strong></h3>
<p>My background and training is in addiction research, so I’m a relative newcomer to the learning and memory field. It’s exciting to see modern neuroscience approaches being applied to theoretically-driven learning and memory studies. Recent work on sex- and individual-differences is also keeping learning and memory research at the cutting edge.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-isare-your-favorite-non-science-related-activities-1" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is/are your favorite non-science related activities?</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve been doing yoga for a few years, and I recently started a ‘Strong-by-Zumba’ class that I love. It’s like 1980’s aerobics, but edgier and without leotards. I also love feeding people and often throw spontaneous dinner parties.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-you-most-proud-of-in-your-career" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What are you most proud of in your career?</strong></h3>
<p>I grew up in a low-income family in Pakistan and now I’m an Associate Professor of Psychology at a Canadian university. Describing this journey is ‘beyond the scope of this article,’ but I’m incredibly proud just to be where I am right now. I love being a scientist, creating opportunity for my lab members, and being in a position where I can advocate for the next generation of scientists.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-influenced-you-the-most-throughout-your-career" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Who influenced you the most throughout your career?</strong></h3>
<p>As a graduate student I was co-supervised by Alan Sved and Anthony Caggiula at the University of Pittsburgh. Alan is whip-smart and sharp as a tack, and Tony is a creative genius. Reconciling the very different feedback that they both gave me on papers did wonders for my scientific writing. I also had an amazing postdoctoral supervisor, Patricia Janak. Tricia gave me independence, resources, and sponsorship, all of which set the stage for me to flourish. Tricia is an incredibly successful, brilliant researcher, and a role model for me and many other scientists.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-you-love-about-the-pavlovian-society-1" class="section level3">

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>We are studying the role of genes associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in habituation of mechanosensory stimuli in <em>C. elegans</em>. These studies go two directions- we hope to contribute to understanding ASD while also deepening our understanding of mechanisms of habituation. This is exciting because it allows my basic science investigations to contribute to understanding a human disease.</p>

<h3><strong>Are there any new techniques in the learning and memory field that you are excited about?</strong></h3>
<p>In <em>C. elegans</em> we have begun to use a genetic technique called Degron Technology that allows us to degrade a specific protein in specific neurons or at specific times in development and this is allowing us to understand what neurons a gene of interest is working in, and when in development it is necessary.</p>

<p>For my postdoc I worked on the development of learning in <em>Aplysia</em> and when I moved to UBC I tried to set up an <em>Aplysia</em> research program and had one disaster after another making it impossible to set up the research (a supplier asked to be paid in advance and then skipped town with 10% of my start-up funds, the mariculture facility that grew baby <em>Aplysia</em> shut down for at least a year, etc.). It would have been easy to give up. However, I met a researcher who studied <em>C. elegans</em> (the same size as baby <em>Aplysia</em>) and I borrowed some to test different brands of dissecting scopes. When my first graduate student and I were testing the scopes we wondered whether they could learn. We investigated and found no one had tested them and so we got to work and within a few months we showed that they could learn and had data for habituation, dishabituation and long-term memory for habituation. I never looked back! I got through it by not focusing on the negative things that happened and by being open to the opportunities that opened up in front of me.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-3" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>The big and somewhat grand problem we (and many other labs) are working on is trying to understand how the brain encodes, stores and uses information. We believe that this is a fundamental property of brain function. One could imagine that dysfunction of information processing could lie at the heart of a number of human disorders (from autism spectrum disorder to Alzheimer’s disease). Our memories make us who we are, and understanding how memories are formed and used, I believe is a hugely fascinating question.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-4" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>Right now I’m most excited about our project with the most unknowns. It’s a collaboration with Bob Datta at Harvard Med School, who’s developed a super-sophisticated behavioral analysis tool using a 3D depth camera that you’d find in an X-box. We’re working with them to evaluate complex conditioned fear behaviors, which could help us develop predictive profiles of resilient vs. susceptible phenotypes in males and females. What I especially love about this project is that it’s completely an undergraduate endeavor – my student Sierra came to work with us having zero lab experience, and I basically said, “See if you can figure out how to do this” and she just did it! I’m constantly amazed at the creativity and resourcefulness my students have.</p>
</div>
<div id="looking-back-at-your-career-so-far-what-are-you-most-proud-of" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Looking back at your career so far, what are you most proud of?</strong></h3>
<p>Our lab motto is “No shrugging” – meaning, if something seems wrong, don’t live with it; fix it. So it might sound hokey, but I’m most proud of the times that I refused to shrug. This includes successfully fighting a negative tenure decision—one of the most mentally and emotionally challenging 6 months of my life—and being a long-time vocal advocate for studying both sexes in neuroscience research. In both cases, I feel like I have genuinely helped move the needle on the way people think about the culture of academic science, both in and outside of the laboratory, and that’s pretty satisfying.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-werent-a-scientist-what-would-you-be-1" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?</strong></h3>
<p>I wouldn’t have known how to answer this question five years ago, but in 2015 my husband and I bought a dilapidated little house in East Boston and did a full gut renovation, just like on HGTV! We didn’t do the construction work ourselves, but I designed the whole house, and although there was a lot about the process that was super stressful, I really loved the creative aspect. Picking out backsplash tile, wallpaper, floor stain, and seeing all those little decisions come together into beautiful spaces (that I now get to live in!) was just awesome. I learned a ton and found that I may have a bit of an eye for this stuff. So if I had to start over and couldn’t choose science as a career, I would probably go to design school and help people make their homes pretty.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-isare-your-favorite-non-science-related-activity-1" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is/are your favorite non-science related activity?</strong></h3>
<p>It’s summer, and so I am VERY into my vegetable garden. We’re super lucky to have a backyard right in the middle of the city, and we have raised beds with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, string beans, and herbs. Every morning before I leave for lab I pour myself a little iced coffee and go out and just look at all my plants in total awe that they were these tiny little things not even 2 months ago and now they’re gigantic and producing all this amazing fruit. On the weekends I work to keep the tomatoes suckers pinched and the cucumber vines going up—it’s a fun thing to focus on that not only keeps me from thinking about work all the time, but is also incredibly rewarding and delicious!</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-your-dream-vacation" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is your dream vacation?</strong></h3>
<p>Without question, I want to go to Japan for like a month and just eat. Traveling and eating are two of my favorite activities, so if my plan to be an interior decorator doesn’t work out, I suppose I could fall back on hosting a show where I just travel to amazing places and eat.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-you-love-about-the-pavlovian-society-3" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve only been involved in Pavlovian Society for a couple of years so I admit that in a sense I feel like a bit of an impostor. The science is amazing, obviously. But what Pavlovian really gets right—and what is immediately clear to a newcomer—is its inclusivity. Even though there are some true legends involved, it doesn’t feel like one of those scientific societies that’s run by the “old guard.” There are visible leadership roles for trainees, and I think that’s a really fantastic model that other societies should emulate. I also love the Women’s luncheon. It is so, so important to highlight the amazing accomplishments of women in our field, while also speaking plainly and openly about the challenges women in STEM continue to face.</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>All the projects! My biggest issue is wanting to do all the things, all the time. But, probably the neuroimmune modulation of memory project.

<h3><strong>What advice would you give yourself as a graduate student?</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t feel the need to follow “the rules” of how an academic career is supposed to work. Do it your own way. It will either work out or it won’t, but you’ll be happier for following your own path along the way.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-werent-a-scientist-what-would-you-be-2" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?</strong></h3>
<p>This is an existential question for me! I’ll always be a scientist, even if I don’t always work in academia or science. But outside of academia? I have no idea. I’ve never had a Plan B. I’ve never really had a Master Plan either - I’ve just followed what I loved and sought out opportunities as I’ve gone along. But in an alternate timeline where I did not study science at university, I would probably have continued to study music – composition more than performance.</p>

<p>A bus trip with my family through the center of Australia to Uluru (Ayers Rock) when I was 10. You wouldn’t think that days and days and days on a bus through the desert where the only other kids were your own siblings would be so fun, but it was a great trip.</p>

<p>I love that it has a great cross-section of people that study memory across all levels of analysis, starting with theory and behavior, to circuits and systems, and molecular mechanisms. And all of whom come back to the importance of understanding behavior as a central tenet to how to study learning and memory.</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>The people in my lab have been working on some awesome projects! My graduate student Gerardo Rojas is beginning some experiments we’ve wanted to pursue for a few years now, related to how dopamine function might be different in mouse models of autism, and how this might relate to their different approaches to motivated behavior and executive function. He’s already finding things I wouldn’t have expected. It’s thrilling to see something exist just because we had an idea. But equally exciting is the work my graduate student Cathy Chen is doing to understand how strategies in decision making in a reinforcement learning task differs in male and female animals, which is pulling us into research directions I didn’t know existed a a few years ago. I admit that as thrilling as getting to find out answers to our burning questions can be, its even more satisfying to have people in the lab develop independence to come up with better questions than I ever would, and answer them. So I would say I’m most excited for the things I don’t know yet!</p>

<div id="is-there-any-advice-you-want-to-give-to-trainees-in-the-learning-field" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Is there any advice you want to give to trainees in the learning field?</strong></h3>
<p>There are lots of people employing learning techniques to prove a point about neuroscience that is fundamentally biological, and they aren’t always doing a very careful job defining what they mean by psychological terms like learning. You have an opportunity as skilled observers of behavior to do science that addresses this problem, but to do so means figuring out which modern neuroscience techniques you want to incorporate into your training. Bridging this gap is incredibly exciting to me. We will never figure out how learning works by being precise in one domain and vague in another.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-werent-a-scientist-what-would-you-be-3" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?</strong></h3>
<p>Noted, independently wealthy bon vivant and wit. Or, failing this, I might work with animal behavior in some non-scientific way, like training animals for film productions. I really enjoy training both my own pets and other people’s. In both of these career paths, there’s a lot of figuring out how to connect with the individual in front of you, whether you are trying to make them laugh (humans), trying to make them sit (animals), or trying to make them shake hands (both).</p>

Those are important too, but sometimes you need the expertise of a bunch of behavioral scientists.</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>I pretty excited about all the work going on in our lab. But at the top of my mind right now is a project we’ve been working on basically since I started the lab. We are picking apart the reciprocal cortical-amygdala circuit that helps you learn about rewarding events and then retrieve those memories in the future to make good reward pursuit decisions.</p>

<div id="why-is-your-research-important-to-the-general-public" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Why is your research important to the general public?</strong></h3>
<p>What we’re trying to do is to figure out how your brain learns about rewarding events and how it uses that information to direct your actions, motivations, and decisions. This allows us to expose vulnerabilities in the brain that can lead to maladaptive behavior and mental illness. From there we work to figure out how to restore adaptive function, thus revealing new treatment strategies for mental illness and neurodegenerative diseases. In our lab, we focus on addiction and depression, though our goal is to make our basic science work relevant to a broad array of psychiatric conditions.</p>

<h3><strong>What’s one skill or hobby you want to learn outside of science?</strong></h3>
<p>Photography. I love taking pictures, especially portraits. But lately my toddler won’t sit still for mommy’s photoshoots, so I’ve gotten more into travel/adventure photography. I’m learning, slowly but surely.</p>

<h3><strong>What was the first research question you remember being excited about? Is it totally different from what you do now?</strong></h3>
<p>How do different addictive drugs differentially affect dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens? At the time, FSCV was all the rage and I found it incredibly exciting to give a subject a drug and immediately see how it’s dopamine release changed. It was incredibly reinforcing and the dopamine those data elicited in my nucleus accumbens is probably why I’m a scientist. I still study dopamine.</p>

<h3><strong>Can you describe a turning point that was important to your career?</strong></h3>
<p>When I was a postdoc, David Jentsch invited me to lunch. I had no clue what he wanted to talk about. At that lunch he suggested I apply for the open faculty position in his department, UCLA Psychology. I was shocked, I didn’t think I was yet qualified to go on the job market. His confidence in me gave me confidence in myself. This is my current job and I absolutely love it. I’m incredibly grateful for this career-changing encouragement. I think sometimes as women we don’t put ourselves up for things (grants, jobs, promotions, awards, etc.) for fear we’re not going to be competitive, we’re not ready, we’re not qualified, whatever. In addition to leading to my current job, this experience taught me to just go for the things I want. I hope I’m effective in spreading this advice and encouragement to others.</p>

<div id="whats-your-ideal-sunday-out-of-the-office" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What’s your ideal Sunday out of the office?</strong></h3>
<p>Get up early and head to the Sunday Hollywood farmer’s market with my family. Have a huge breakfast from one of the vendors (usually a crepe or breakfast burrito), and get some delicious fresh local produce. My daughter stuffs herself on free samples. Afterwards we go for a hike in Runyon Canyon or maybe Griffith park if we’re feeling adventurous. Come home for a nap (you said ideal, right? In my ideal world parent naps are a thing). Then head to the park to play with my daughter, followed by happy hour with my family and friends.</p>

<h3><strong>Finally, what do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>The behavior. I love that at this meeting the sophistication in neural analysis and behavioral analysis are both incredibly high. I think this leads to interesting and important advances in understanding associative learning and all the many processes it influences (motivation, emotion, decision making, etc.). I also love how I leave the meeting with lots of great ideas for future experiments and collaborations.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-8" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>We are currently looking at how fear memories are inferred across time. Whether rats do this retrospectively or prospectively makes such memories differentially dependent on the original emotional event and are thus underscored by different associative architecture. We are using the Fos-lacZ transgenic rat to determine whether deletion of neuronal ensembles activated by the original emotional memory affects the integrity of inferred memories. This allows us to look at the interdependence of memories and explore how different brain areas and circuits support this learning. I am very excited about this, because it exemplifies the complexity of normal memory but also bears relevance to the difficulty of treating trauma-based psychopathologies in humans.</p>

<h3><strong>Are there any benefits to being a woman in learning?</strong></h3>
<p>It is a great time to be a woman in the field of learning and neuroscience. Awareness of the hardship faced by women is growing fast and I feel lucky that this is happening in my lifetime. It also gives us an opportunity to make a difference that will benefit the next generation of female researchers. I also feel really blessed to be part of a network comprised of strong like-minded junior and established female scientists.</p>

<h3><strong>Finally, what do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>The great thing about the Pavlovian Society is that it has really deep behavioral roots, yet this does not come at the expense of cutting-edge neuroscience. Without understanding behavior, there is no hope of understanding brain function. The Pavlovian Society does not compromise and really has this right. I am really proud to be a part of it.</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>Right now, we have some exciting neural data from the PFC collected in freely behaving rats during our safety learning task. At the single neuron level, we are seeing many neurons in the infralimbic cortex responding to a learned safety cue while fear behavior is being suppressed.</p>

<div id="what-challenges-if-any-have-you-experienced-as-a-woman-in-learning" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What challenges, if any, have you experienced as a woman in learning?</strong></h3>
<p>I feel like I have been overall quite lucky to have had really supportive mentors, both male and female, throughout my career. However, when I got my faculty position and was the ‘boss’ of the lab and classroom, it appeared to me I was not getting the same level of respect from students, in the classroom and in the lab, as a new male PI would.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-advice-would-you-give-yourself-10-years-ago-1" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?</strong></h3>
<p>That would be 2009, when I finished my first postdoc and was starting my second postdoc. The thing I did right was take a chance and start my line of research on safety learning. The advice I would give myself would probably be “ok, breathe, relax, it’ll all be fine”. I was too stressed about getting the faculty position. I obviously succeeded in getting one, but life would have been fine if I didn’t.</p>
