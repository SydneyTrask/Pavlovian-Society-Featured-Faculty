<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>Although I am passionate about all of the ongoing projects in the lab, I am really excited about our work focusing on identifying the neurobiology underlying hormonal regulation of decision making. I think the findings from these experiments may hold significant promise for developing strategies to rescue cognitive impairments that contribute to the persistent nature of substance use disorders. Stay tuned.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-best-part-about-being-a-pi" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is the best part about being a PI?</strong></h3>
<p>I think the best part about being a PI is also the most challenging. I now have the freedom and latitude to develop a research program and a research team focused on scientific issues that I care deeply about. This is not to say I did not care about the work I did as a PhD student and a postdoctoral fellow; in those positions, however, my focus was guided and influenced by my supervisors. As a PI, I am now the one who dictates the direction of the lab and who now influences the trainees in my own lab. With this creative freedom and independence also comes an immense amount of responsibility, for the continued productivity of the lab and for my trainees. Although this is a challenging part of the job, I still wake up every day excited by the possibility of scientific discovery and the knowledge that I can contribute to its pursuit.</p>

<div id="whats-been-most-rewarding-about-starting-a-new-lab" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What’s been most rewarding about starting a new lab?</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most rewarding aspects of starting a new lab is to see my vision of the lab become reality. As an incessant planner, I had designed and planned the layout and structure of the lab long before I arrived at UT. The process of acting upon those plans and building the lab was more gratifying than I had anticipated. The final product is one that I am immensely proud of. Equally rewarding, however, was accepting my first PhD student and mentoring her as we both began these new chapters of our lives. As a new PI, I have the time and ability to work closely with my trainees and I therefore see firsthand how they develop as scientists. The reason I pursued a career in academia was borne out of my desire to have the same impact my mentors had on me. I now have that opportunity and it is one of the most fulfilling parts of my job.</p>

<h3><strong>What do you wish you knew when you were a trainee about running a lab?</strong></h3>
<p>The amount of time spent responding to emails. When I first started my lab, I could not believe how much time I spent on emails. Because I felt distracted and interrupted when I kept my email open during the day, I have since self-imposed an email policy where I only check it in the morning and in the afternoon, spending 30 minutes each time managing emails before closing it again and returning to what I had been doing.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-you-love-about-the-pavlovian-society" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>There are so many things to love about the Pavlovian Society, but I will highlight two. First, the scientific community is supportive and caring, creating the feeling of a large family rather than a professional organization. The second thing that I most appreciate about the Pavlovian Society is the almost singular focus on understanding behavior. We are often distracted by new techniques and methods to examine the neurobiological basis of behavior, but to be able to use those tools effectively, we still need to understand the complexity of the behavior itself. Ultimately, don’t we all want to know why we do what we do? The Pavlovian Society epitomizes this sentiment (although not at the expense of innovative neuroscience) and, for this reason, it will always remain one of my favorite scientific communities.</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>I’m developing a new task to look at how social cues can influence active avoidance. Using the platform-mediated avoidance task, I’m going to train rats to learn avoidance with a social partner. Their partner will have different experiences related to fear/avoidance, and I want to know how the learned experiences of the partner affect the other rats’ learning of avoidance. We would hypothesize that a partner already familiar with avoidance would cause the other rat to learn avoidance quickly through observational learning. But would a fearful partner have the same effect or might it impair avoidance learning of the other rat? I’m using this paradigm to understand how individuals develop resiliency through social cues/interactions.</p>

<p>Making so many big decisions. As a trainee, you often rely on your PI/mentor that they will know what to do, but when you have your own lab, it’s all on you. There’s a lot to figure out that you weren’t exactly taught as a trainee, especially managing people and money. It’s good to find a community or support system who can give you advice on how to navigate being a New PI. Also, you have to organize your time and schedule really well, otherwise you’ll end up forgetting about meetings and deadlines really fast!</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-2" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>I have been studying sex differences in the stress neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), for years. My early work found that the locus coeruleus-arousal system of female rats was more sensitive to CRF than that of male rats due to sex differences in the CRF1 receptor. Recently, my lab as been looking at other regions that are a target of CRF regulation with a focus on cholinergic areas. My former grad student, Kim Wiersielis, found that CRF in the medial septum (a major source of acetylcholine for the hippocampus) impairs spatial learning in male and female rats. However, males are more sensitive, responding to a low dose of CRF in the medial septum that does not affect females. Females may be protected from low levels of CRF in the medial septum, because in this region they have more CRF binding protein, an endogenous protein that sequesters CRF preventing its bioavailability. My lab was recently funded by the NSF to follow up on this project and determine what causes these sex differences, discover more about CRF binding protein (e.g., what septal cells produce it, etc.), and link CRF in the medial septum to hippocampal changes in acetylcholine release. What I find fascinating about CRF is that there are sex differences in sensitivity to this important stress neuropeptide, but they are region specific. Of course, stress affects both sexes. However, sex differences in CRF sensitivity can drive different responses to stress that may, in some cases, lead to different stress vulnerabilities in males vs. females. Psychiatric disorders are exacerbated by stress, and epidemiological data reveal that women are more likely to suffer from disorders with hyperarousal features, such as PTSD, and men are more likely to suffer from disorders with cognitive deficits, such as schizophrenia. It is possible that sex differences in stress responses contribute to some of the sex differences in psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>I have two favorite parts: discovery and mentoring. It is so exciting to get new data, especially if it is unexpected and challenges my preconceived notions about how something would turn out. I also enjoy training and mentoring students. We have a lot of undergrads in the lab, who understandably have no experience. It’s great to see them go from learning lab basics to contributing intellectually to projects. Mentoring grad students is also rewarding. I’m always impressed with how quickly they gain expertise and begin to drive their science. I’m so lucky to have a job where I can help facilitate this growth.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-3" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>We are really excited about some data that has been piling up looking into how animals resolve risk-reward conflicts. One of the most fun parts of this has been to come up with ways to solve some of the confounds in the design of decision making tasks that sometimes we feel we have to use in order to get the rats to give us reliable data. But, not surprisingly, the rats are highly adaptive and creative in solving more continuously-updating tasks and using that information appropriately – just like they would in a more naturalistic setting. With that perspective, we’ve been using these newer models of decision making where our subjects can “wager” bets as they choose and we can model neural activity in these processes to see how the brain encodes this kind of information, and of course what happens when they win or lose.</p>
<p>Beyond the specific experiments in my lab, though, I’ve been encouraged to see the field moving in a direction that is embracing the fuller range of animal behavior in the last few years. For as long as I’ve been a researcher, the emphasis (including my own!) has often been on designing tasks that fit the researchers’ needs such as discrete stimuli and reliable repeatable effects, whether or not those effects are actually any good at modeling anything with translatable value. But recently, there’s been a growing appreciation of all the complexity we need to think about when translating our animal models into human public health situations. For example, in the drug addiction world, there’s been a reckoning about what – if anything – our self-administration models are actually modeling. The renewed focus on the variety of access schedules, concurrent access with competing outcomes, persistent drug taking in the face of aversive consequences – all of these are giving the field some real renewed enthusiasm in trying to understand how we think about addiction and the brain, and thus how we think about the value of our research models. I think that a time in which we have unprecedented access to the most sophisticated molecular tools, there’s this parallel drive to really think about the importance and validity of our behavioral approaches. In the end, sophisticated tools don’t amount to much translational value to human health if we aren’t getting the basic behavioral models correct. So all of that renewed appreciation of behavioral approaches, including a range of great work from researchers and support from NIH itself, is also driving my excitement in the lab right now.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-best-part-about-being-a-pi-3" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is the best part about being a PI?</strong></h3>
<p>I guess it’d have to be the sort of active ferment of ideas being driven by all the minds in the group. As I’ve gotten more experience running a lab, “letting go” has been part of my mentoring strategy, because honestly, the individual talents and passions of each of my amazing trainees has been something you can’t really plan for other than in a very general stochastic sense. Everyone brings with them these unique set of experiences, both from their previous labs and from the world generally, that guides what lights a spark in them and gets them exciting about being in the lab. Over time, I’ve been better able to learn how to create spaces for the trainees to push their ideas and to fold those into the ongoing lab goals in a more organic way than I was able to do when I was just starting my lab. As such, we have really amazing projects going on that have been driven by ideas from postdocs, grad students, and even some exceptionally talented undergrads that weren’t even on my radar as of a couple years ago. Running the lab you have a better appreciation of how there’s a satisfying way all the organic messy pieces often click together. That ability to take a moment and look back at that path, and really appreciate the collaborative aspect of the whole process with such a passionate group of people has been really rewarding.</p>

<h3><strong>If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?</strong></h3>
<p>As a junior faculty, you kind of always have this in the back of your mind, I suppose. I don’t have a huge backlog of repressed talents to fall back on, but being in this job for a while now, I’ve come to really appreciate how much value comes from the totality of our jobs as scientists. Mostly what I discover is that you could theoretically fill your days with non-research-related activities that could have a huge impact on people’s lives in an immediate way, and sometimes it’s hard to step away from that because you know you absolutely do not have the time and resources to keep that going. Maybe if I couldn’t be a scientist, those would be a great way to move these projects forward.</p>

<h3><strong>If you could go anywhere in the world and do anything for one day, where would you go and what would you do?</strong></h3>
<p>I suppose my answer would be bikepacking though bike-friendly parts of the world, and eating liberally of local foods along the way. I’ve never biked through Europe, but I watch a lot of cycling and like to imagine what it’d be like to trace the routes of the Classics. On a typical day here, unless there’s ice on the ground, you can usually find me on my bike year round, and I find that it’s the best way to see the world in general. Living in Boulder, there are a lot of cyclists here, but they all seem to enjoy pointing themselves straight uphill and summiting mountains. And you know, hats off to them. But as a native Iowan, my tastes are still firmly trend towards the long rolling hills variety, hitting towns every 20mi or so to stop for some local delicacy.</p>

<h3><strong>What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>I was raised by behavior-driven mentors, and they really drilled into me how to approach critical problems in neuroscience through a behavior lens. Animals evolved to solve problems in their environment, and so it follows that if you want to know how the brain works, it’s essential to know what it’s for and how it’s used. The fashionability of behavior ebbs and flows in the behavioral neuroscience, but through it all, Pavlovian Society provide a home for people who work on these problems in earnest and make progress on these important issues. The community has been really great in this regard, providing connections across labs and training opportunities for younger scientists to developing this thinking and skills. I mean, between profiles like this and Jeff’s regular updating on Society jobs and news, it’s really a special community, and proud to be part of it!</p>

<p>Recently we’ve had several surprising outcomes from our mainstream projects examining the amygdala circuits mediating individual differences in Pavlovian devaluation sensitivity, which continue to be very exciting for me.

<h3><strong>Looking back at your career so far, what are you most proud of?</strong></h3>
<p>Feeling simultaneously proud of the mentoring/training environments I came from and the one I have managed to create. This realization came recently after I experienced a sudden personal loss that kept me away from the lab for several months. While I was away, I had falsely anticipated that my absence would have a substantial negative impact on lab productivity, culture and experimental outcomes. Upon my return, I was humbled and relieved to find out how wrong I was. First, the data. The incredible data that came out of that time in the lab was inspiring. It was clear that trainees leaned on one another in order to navigate the day to day challenges of running their studies. Second, the strengthened bonds between team members were evidence that we all made it through something big, and we would all be stronger for it. I am forever grateful for my science family, past and present, that supported us through the challenging time. Finally, I was super proud of how each trainee demonstrated deeper and more independent thinking about their projects. This has taken our work in new directions and showed me that I could, and should, let go of the intellectual micromanagement. Though admittedly I see how this is creeping back and it’s important to keep it in check, so thanks for asking!</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>We have a new study focused on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and fear conditioning. We are specifically interested in the impact that being able to predict and control a threat (i.e. an aversive unconditioned stimulus; UCS) has on behavior and the neural function that supports learning. Nate Harnett’s work from the lab has previously demonstrated that trauma-exposed participants show fear learning deficits. Kimberly Wood’s work in the lab has shown that the hippocampal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity of healthy volunteers varies with the predictability and controllability of the UCS. Our current study, led by Heather Dark and Juliann Purcell, will determine whether the ability to predict and control the UCS alters fear learning in unique ways for those with PTSD compared to those without PTSD and will shed new light on the neural function that underlies these learning-related processes.</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>There are two projects that I’m super excited about right now. First, we are trying to understand the functional role of circadian genes in modulating memory formation across the day/night cycle. We have found that at least one circadian gene, Period1 (Per1) plays an important role in memory formation and our most recent data suggest that Per1 may function differently during the day versus at night, changing the likelihood of memory formation. We’re also investigating how memories are modified in response to new information. As a side project in my postdoc lab, I developed a task (called OUL – Objects in Updated Locations) that can assess both an original memory and updated information in a single test session. We’re using OUL now to figure out how memory updating is different from initial memory formation.</p>

<p>Work on your communication skills, both speaking and writing. As an incoming graduate student I had no idea how much of this job involves writing and speaking. Being able to communicate your science is fundamental and can be the difference in whether you get a job offer or get a grant. These are things that you learn with time, so practice early and often.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-7" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>It’s impossible to pick a favourite, so I’ll tell you about 2. My graduate students (Alexa Brown and Franz Villaruel) are studying brain regions involved in appetitive extinction. Experiments in this project that branched away from standard extinction paradigms have produced exciting results. Another graduate student (Mandy LeCocq) adapted the reinstatement paradigm for use with alcohol, and her project is generating heaps of interesting data.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-triggered-your-passion-for-studying-learning-and-memory" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What triggered your passion for studying learning and memory?</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve always loved biology, and have a clear memory from high school of the first time I saw cell division through a microscope. I wasn’t introduced to the brain or Psychology until college, and my fascination with biology transmuted into a desire to understand the neural basis of behaviour, particularly maladaptive behaviour like excessive drug use. I draw on the rigorous behavioural designs in learning and memory research to inform my work on extinction learning and substance use disorders.</p>

</div>
<div id="what-are-you-most-excited-about-in-the-learning-and-memory-field" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What are you most excited about in the learning and memory field?</strong></h3>
<p>My background and training is in addiction research, so I’m a relative newcomer to the learning and memory field. It’s exciting to see modern neuroscience approaches being applied to theoretically-driven learning and memory studies. Recent work on sex- and individual-differences is also keeping learning and memory research at the cutting edge.</p>

<h3><strong>What are you most proud of in your career?</strong></h3>
<p>I grew up in a low-income family in Pakistan and now I’m an Associate Professor of Psychology at a Canadian university. Describing this journey is ‘beyond the scope of this article,’ but I’m incredibly proud just to be where I am right now. I love being a scientist, creating opportunity for my lab members, and being in a position where I can advocate for the next generation of scientists.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-influenced-you-the-most-throughout-your-career" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Who influenced you the most throughout your career?</strong></h3>
<p>As a graduate student I was co-supervised by Alan Sved and Anthony Caggiula at the University of Pittsburgh. Alan is whip-smart and sharp as a tack, and Tony is a creative genius. Reconciling the very different feedback that they both gave me on papers did wonders for my scientific writing. I also had an amazing postdoctoral supervisor, Patricia Janak. Tricia gave me independence, resources, and sponsorship, all of which set the stage for me to flourish. Tricia is an incredibly successful, brilliant researcher, and a role model for me and many other scientists.</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>We are studying the role of genes associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in habituation of mechanosensory stimuli in <em>C. elegans</em>. These studies go two directions- we hope to contribute to understanding ASD while also deepening our understanding of mechanisms of habituation. This is exciting because it allows my basic science investigations to contribute to understanding a human disease.</p>

<h3><strong>Are there any new techniques in the learning and memory field that you are excited about?</strong></h3>
<p>In <em>C. elegans</em> we have begun to use a genetic technique called Degron Technology that allows us to degrade a specific protein in specific neurons or at specific times in development and this is allowing us to understand what neurons a gene of interest is working in, and when in development it is necessary.</p>

<div id="what-was-your-first-research-experience-1" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What was your first research experience?</strong></h3>
<p>I did my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. For my Honors project I did an event-recorder behavior study of the activity of seals in captivity trying to determine what they spent their days doing- swimming, sleeping or interacting. This was to help design new housing facility for them. It was in an unheated hut in an Ontario winter and I nearly froze to death!</p>

<div id="what-has-been-your-biggest-career-challenge-and-how-did-you-get-through-it" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What has been your biggest career challenge and how did you get through it?</strong></h3>
<p>For my postdoc I worked on the development of learning in <em>Aplysia</em> and when I moved to UBC I tried to set up an <em>Aplysia</em> research program and had one disaster after another making it impossible to set up the research (a supplier asked to be paid in advance and then skipped town with 10% of my start-up funds, the mariculture facility that grew baby <em>Aplysia</em> shut down for at least a year, etc.). It would have been easy to give up. However, I met a researcher who studied <em>C. elegans</em> (the same size as baby <em>Aplysia</em>) and I borrowed some to test different brands of dissecting scopes. When my first graduate student and I were testing the scopes we wondered whether they could learn. We investigated and found no one had tested them and so we got to work and within a few months we showed that they could learn and had data for habituation, dishabituation and long-term memory for habituation. I never looked back! I got through it by not focusing on the negative things that happened and by being open to the opportunities that opened up in front of me.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-9" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>The big and somewhat grand problem we (and many other labs) are working on is trying to understand how the brain encodes, stores and uses information. We believe that this is a fundamental property of brain function. One could imagine that dysfunction of information processing could lie at the heart of a number of human disorders (from autism spectrum disorder to Alzheimer’s disease). Our memories make us who we are, and understanding how memories are formed and used, I believe is a hugely fascinating question.</p>

<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>Right now I’m most excited about our project with the most unknowns. It’s a collaboration with Bob Datta at Harvard Med School, who’s developed a super-sophisticated behavioral analysis tool using a 3D depth camera that you’d find in an X-box. We’re working with them to evaluate complex conditioned fear behaviors, which could help us develop predictive profiles of resilient vs. susceptible phenotypes in males and females. What I especially love about this project is that it’s completely an undergraduate endeavor – my student Sierra came to work with us having zero lab experience, and I basically said, “See if you can figure out how to do this” and she just did it! I’m constantly amazed at the creativity and resourcefulness my students have.</p>
</div>
<div id="looking-back-at-your-career-so-far-what-are-you-most-proud-of-1" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Looking back at your career so far, what are you most proud of?</strong></h3>
<p>Our lab motto is “No shrugging” – meaning, if something seems wrong, don’t live with it; fix it. So it might sound hokey, but I’m most proud of the times that I refused to shrug. This includes successfully fighting a negative tenure decision—one of the most mentally and emotionally challenging 6 months of my life—and being a long-time vocal advocate for studying both sexes in neuroscience research. In both cases, I feel like I have genuinely helped move the needle on the way people think about the culture of academic science, both in and outside of the laboratory, and that’s pretty satisfying.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-werent-a-scientist-what-would-you-be-6" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?</strong></h3>
<p>I wouldn’t have known how to answer this question five years ago, but in 2015 my husband and I bought a dilapidated little house in East Boston and did a full gut renovation, just like on HGTV! We didn’t do the construction work ourselves, but I designed the whole house, and although there was a lot about the process that was super stressful, I really loved the creative aspect. Picking out backsplash tile, wallpaper, floor stain, and seeing all those little decisions come together into beautiful spaces (that I now get to live in!) was just awesome. I learned a ton and found that I may have a bit of an eye for this stuff. So if I had to start over and couldn’t choose science as a career, I would probably go to design school and help people make their homes pretty.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-isare-your-favorite-non-science-related-activity-1" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is/are your favorite non-science related activity?</strong></h3>
<p>It’s summer, and so I am VERY into my vegetable garden. We’re super lucky to have a backyard right in the middle of the city, and we have raised beds with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, string beans, and herbs. Every morning before I leave for lab I pour myself a little iced coffee and go out and just look at all my plants in total awe that they were these tiny little things not even 2 months ago and now they’re gigantic and producing all this amazing fruit. On the weekends I work to keep the tomatoes suckers pinched and the cucumber vines going up—it’s a fun thing to focus on that not only keeps me from thinking about work all the time, but is also incredibly rewarding and delicious!</p>

<p>Without question, I want to go to Japan for like a month and just eat. Traveling and eating are two of my favorite activities, so if my plan to be an interior decorator doesn’t work out, I suppose I could fall back on hosting a show where I just travel to amazing places and eat.</p>

<h3><strong>What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve only been involved in Pavlovian Society for a couple of years so I admit that in a sense I feel like a bit of an impostor. The science is amazing, obviously. But what Pavlovian really gets right—and what is immediately clear to a newcomer—is its inclusivity. Even though there are some true legends involved, it doesn’t feel like one of those scientific societies that’s run by the “old guard.” There are visible leadership roles for trainees, and I think that’s a really fantastic model that other societies should emulate. I also love the Women’s luncheon. It is so, so important to highlight the amazing accomplishments of women in our field, while also speaking plainly and openly about the challenges women in STEM continue to face.</p>

<p>This is an existential question for me! I’ll always be a scientist, even if I don’t always work in academia or science. But outside of academia? I have no idea. I’ve never had a Plan B. I’ve never really had a Master Plan either - I’ve just followed what I loved and sought out opportunities as I’ve gone along. But in an alternate timeline where I did not study science at university, I would probably have continued to study music – composition more than performance.</p>

<h3><strong>If you could go anywhere in the world and do anything for one day, where would you go and what would you do?</strong></h3>
<p>Just one day? Just one thing? Something involving spectacular nature views, water to swim/play in, warm weather, and my family. Alternatively: a day in Antarctica.</p>

<div id="what-is-one-of-your-favorite-memories-as-a-child" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is one of your favorite memories as a child?</strong></h3>
<p>A bus trip with my family through the center of Australia to Uluru (Ayers Rock) when I was 10. You wouldn’t think that days and days and days on a bus through the desert where the only other kids were your own siblings would be so fun, but it was a great trip.</p>

<div id="what-do-you-love-about-the-pavlovian-society-9" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>I love that it has a great cross-section of people that study memory across all levels of analysis, starting with theory and behavior, to circuits and systems, and molecular mechanisms. And all of whom come back to the importance of understanding behavior as a central tenet to how to study learning and memory.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-12" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>The people in my lab have been working on some awesome projects! My graduate student Gerardo Rojas is beginning some experiments we’ve wanted to pursue for a few years now, related to how dopamine function might be different in mouse models of autism, and how this might relate to their different approaches to motivated behavior and executive function. He’s already finding things I wouldn’t have expected. It’s thrilling to see something exist just because we had an idea. But equally exciting is the work my graduate student Cathy Chen is doing to understand how strategies in decision making in a reinforcement learning task differs in male and female animals, which is pulling us into research directions I didn’t know existed a a few years ago. I admit that as thrilling as getting to find out answers to our burning questions can be, its even more satisfying to have people in the lab develop independence to come up with better questions than I ever would, and answer them. So I would say I’m most excited for the things I don’t know yet!</p>

<div id="looking-back-at-your-career-so-far-what-are-you-most-proud-of-2" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Looking back at your career so far, what are you most proud of?</strong></h3>
<p>Surviving! Surviving despite the fact that the vast majority of the time, I am basically winging it. But so is everybody else, for the most part.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-there-any-advice-you-want-to-give-to-trainees-in-the-learning-field" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Is there any advice you want to give to trainees in the learning field?</strong></h3>
<p>There are lots of people employing learning techniques to prove a point about neuroscience that is fundamentally biological, and they aren’t always doing a very careful job defining what they mean by psychological terms like learning. You have an opportunity as skilled observers of behavior to do science that addresses this problem, but to do so means figuring out which modern neuroscience techniques you want to incorporate into your training. Bridging this gap is incredibly exciting to me. We will never figure out how learning works by being precise in one domain and vague in another.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-werent-a-scientist-what-would-you-be-8" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>If you weren’t a scientist, what would you be?</strong></h3>
<p>Noted, independently wealthy bon vivant and wit. Or, failing this, I might work with animal behavior in some non-scientific way, like training animals for film productions. I really enjoy training both my own pets and other people’s. In both of these career paths, there’s a lot of figuring out how to connect with the individual in front of you, whether you are trying to make them laugh (humans), trying to make them sit (animals), or trying to make them shake hands (both).</p>

<h3><strong>If you could go anywhere in the world and do anything for one day, where would you go and what would you do?</strong></h3>
<p>I once got to go to Lake Como, north of Milan, and ride the ferry between little towns on the lake. I would go back there and I would spend the day figuring out how to stay there longer than one day.</p>

<div id="what-isare-your-favorite-non-science-related-activityactivities" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What is/are your favorite non-science related activity/activities?</strong></h3>
<p>I love shopping for necklaces. Shopping is not the most wholesome activity. Let me try again. I like to drink beverages, both nonalcoholic and boozy, in beautiful environments and listen to my friends. I also like to paint small paintings, usually about 2 or 3 inches in size. I love logic puzzles and party games. The critical thing about all my favorite activities is they always involve access to indoor plumbing and climate control, and usually comfortable chairs.</p>

<div id="what-do-you-love-about-the-pavlovian-society-10" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>I love that there is a dedicated meeting for learned behavior. I appreciate that the motivation for the science is to understand the behavior and learning processes that drive it, not to understand a molecule or a specific circuit. Those are important too, but sometimes you need the expertise of a bunch of behavioral scientists.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-13" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>I pretty excited about all the work going on in our lab. But at the top of my mind right now is a project we’ve been working on basically since I started the lab. We are picking apart the reciprocal cortical-amygdala circuit that helps you learn about rewarding events and then retrieve those memories in the future to make good reward pursuit decisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-is-your-research-important-to-the-general-public" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Why is your research important to the general public?</strong></h3>
<p>What we’re trying to do is to figure out how your brain learns about rewarding events and how it uses that information to direct your actions, motivations, and decisions. This allows us to expose vulnerabilities in the brain that can lead to maladaptive behavior and mental illness. From there we work to figure out how to restore adaptive function, thus revealing new treatment strategies for mental illness and neurodegenerative diseases. In our lab, we focus on addiction and depression, though our goal is to make our basic science work relevant to a broad array of psychiatric conditions.</p>

<div id="whats-one-skill-or-hobby-you-want-to-learn-outside-of-science" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What’s one skill or hobby you want to learn outside of science?</strong></h3>
<p>Photography. I love taking pictures, especially portraits. But lately my toddler won’t sit still for mommy’s photoshoots, so I’ve gotten more into travel/adventure photography. I’m learning, slowly but surely.</p>

<div id="what-was-the-first-research-question-you-remember-being-excited-about-is-it-totally-different-from-what-you-do-now" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What was the first research question you remember being excited about? Is it totally different from what you do now?</strong></h3>
<p>How do different addictive drugs differentially affect dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens? At the time, FSCV was all the rage and I found it incredibly exciting to give a subject a drug and immediately see how it’s dopamine release changed. It was incredibly reinforcing and the dopamine those data elicited in my nucleus accumbens is probably why I’m a scientist. I still study dopamine.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-you-describe-a-turning-point-that-was-important-to-your-career" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Can you describe a turning point that was important to your career?</strong></h3>
<p>When I was a postdoc, David Jentsch invited me to lunch. I had no clue what he wanted to talk about. At that lunch he suggested I apply for the open faculty position in his department, UCLA Psychology. I was shocked, I didn’t think I was yet qualified to go on the job market. His confidence in me gave me confidence in myself. This is my current job and I absolutely love it. I’m incredibly grateful for this career-changing encouragement. I think sometimes as women we don’t put ourselves up for things (grants, jobs, promotions, awards, etc.) for fear we’re not going to be competitive, we’re not ready, we’re not qualified, whatever. In addition to leading to my current job, this experience taught me to just go for the things I want. I hope I’m effective in spreading this advice and encouragement to others.</p>

<div id="whats-your-ideal-sunday-out-of-the-office" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What’s your ideal Sunday out of the office?</strong></h3>
<p>Get up early and head to the Sunday Hollywood farmer’s market with my family. Have a huge breakfast from one of the vendors (usually a crepe or breakfast burrito), and get some delicious fresh local produce. My daughter stuffs herself on free samples. Afterwards we go for a hike in Runyon Canyon or maybe Griffith park if we’re feeling adventurous. Come home for a nap (you said ideal, right? In my ideal world parent naps are a thing). Then head to the park to play with my daughter, followed by happy hour with my family and friends.</p>

<h3><strong>Finally, what do you love about the Pavlovian Society?</strong></h3>
<p>The behavior. I love that at this meeting the sophistication in neural analysis and behavioral analysis are both incredibly high. I think this leads to interesting and important advances in understanding associative learning and all the many processes it influences (motivation, emotion, decision making, etc.). I also love how I leave the meeting with lots of great ideas for future experiments and collaborations.</p>

<div id="what-project-are-you-currently-most-excited-about-in-your-lab-14" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>What project are you currently most excited about in your lab?</strong></h3>
<p>We are currently looking at how fear memories are inferred across time. Whether rats do this retrospectively or prospectively makes such memories differentially dependent on the original emotional event and are thus underscored by different associative architecture. We are using the Fos-lacZ transgenic rat to determine whether deletion of neuronal ensembles activated by the original emotional memory affects the integrity of inferred memories. This allows us to look at the interdependence of memories and explore how different brain areas and circuits support this learning. I am very excited about this, because it exemplifies the complexity of normal memory but also bears relevance to the difficulty of treating trauma-based psychopathologies in humans.</p>
